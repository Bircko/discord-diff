# discord-diff

Repository holding changes on Discord's obfuscated class names, whether it's rerolls or renames but not non-obfuscated to obfuscated ones.

## Replacer script

You can use [@de-odex](https://github.com/de-odex)'s [py3 replacer script](https://gist.github.com/de-odex/1e798300506338c10c9f8abb78e822e2) to quickly replace all the old class names in your theme/plugin.

Of course, you can create your own. It's only `#` for comments and `old||new`
